/*
- take assignment 5 and use arrays only.
- part 2 - 7 are basically the same as assignment 5.
- uses dynamic arrays.
- code is hidden on posted code on dynamic arrays
- counts as 5% on the final
- no vectors allowed because it's too easy
- can creat temp variables in main.cpp
-
//
cylinder * containers;
containers = new cylinder[s]
cylinder tmp (r, h)
containers[i] = tmp
// - above is illegal

- create object and stick into array.
- avoid memory leaks
- cant create tmp cylinder obect
- prompts for 3 different cylinder costs
- check sample output for example
- store shipping cost and paint cost into their own array
- code is found in his notes from 1 demensional and 2 demensional arrays
