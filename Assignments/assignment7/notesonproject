Matrix program

int **element = a pointer that will point 2 dimensional array i.e a matrix

contructor sets everything to 0.

make sure you use a deep copy from "a" into "element"


operator* = below
if columns != rhs.rows
return empty matrix()

if giving segfaults comment out DESTRUCTOR to check your math and you know
then your problems the DESTRUCTOR
also memory leaks can be screwed.
