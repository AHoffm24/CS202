/*
abstract data types (ADT)
separate logic from implementation details

we only care about the behavior of the object


notable ADT's
- stack
- queue
- min-heap //mainly used in data structures and algorythms
- max-heap
//4 above are all called priority queues
 a queue is a list(container of element)

 - stack is a priority queue
    - top of the stack has the highest priority and is next to be done
    essentially a container class
    - last in, first out(LIFO)
    - functions
        - push : places item on top of the stack
        - pop  : takes item off the top of the stack
        - top  : retrieves top item without removing
        - isEmpty : tells you if stack is empty
        - might have a question of how is it implemented; array or linked list
            answer: no one cares because it just works
            but link list are easier to implement because you can just add to
            the back

 - queue
    basically think of it as a line in a grocery store.
 - min-heap
    d
 -max-heap
    md
